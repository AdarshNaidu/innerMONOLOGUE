        <p>
          An internal monologue, also called self-talk or inner speech, is a
          person's inner voice which provides a running verbal monologue of
          thoughts while they are conscious.
        </p>

        <h1>Why is it important?</h1>
        <p>
          Your thoughts are the source of your emotions and mood. The
          conversations you have with yourself can get destructive or
          beneficial.
        </p>
        <p>
          People who can master positive self-talk are thought to be more
          confident, motivated, and productive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Banishing your inner critic and learning how to have productive,
          positive inner conversations has no downside. It's a worthwhile step
          toward bettering yourself and improving your sense of self-worth.
