## What's Inner Monologue?
An internal monologue, also called self-talk or inner speech, is a person's inner voice which provides a running verbal monologue of thoughts while they are conscious.  

## Why is it important?
Your thoughts are the source of your emotions and mood. The conversations you have with yourself can get destructive or beneficial.
People who can master positive self-talk are thought to be more confident, motivated, and productive.
Banishing your inner critic and learning how to have productive, positive inner conversations has no downside. It's a worthwhile step toward bettering yourself and improving your sense of self-worth.
